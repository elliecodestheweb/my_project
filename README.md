Kickoff project using HTML and CSS

This is my first website, built using the HTML & CSS module project from Skillcrush 'Jubilee Austen'. 
As I am learning, this serves as my testing grounds for writing code and eventually will remove this page and start a new website.

This also serves as a testing ground for learning to use Git/GitHub/GitHub for Desktop/Git Bash, etc...

If you have stumbled upon this mess, please forgive me!
